                It was early in the morning on January 30<sup>th</sup>, 2021. Alex, Sophie, and Auntie Tu Phung headed out to Grotto Mountain near Canmore, AB for a hike in -11° weather. At the first summit, Alex asked Sophie’s aunt to take a picture of them. As Sophie and Alex posed for their photo, Alex sneakily got down on one knee and asked Sophie to marry him! Sophie just made unintelligible high-pitched noises.
