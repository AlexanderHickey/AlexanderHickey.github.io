                People have referred to Alex and Sophie as "the greatest couple in the history of time".
                They have also called them "a power couple the likes of which the world has never before seen".

                Sophie and Alex met while working together at a local fast-food restaurant. Alex was one of Sophie’s favourite people to work with because he would always cut the crust off of her toast. They became closer friends after they both quit working at said fast-food restaurant, and started having a Disney movie night every Wednesday. According to Alex, Sophie became smitten when she witnessed him eating over 100 shrimps on their first date. According to Sophie, their first date happened at the Cactus Club after Alex texted her saying “I want to take you on a date”. This date was clearly a big deal for Alex too because he drove home after school to change into a dress shirt and tie to pick Sophie up for said date. A heavily intoxicated woman also interrupted their date and told them that they were soulmates (boy, if she only knew).

                Regardless of these conflicting recollections/opinions of events, Sophie and Alex agree that they are each other’s adventure buddies for life. Sophie and Alex have climbed countless mountain peaks and eaten innumerable ramen bowls together. Sophie, Alex, and the puppers have now moved to their new home in Waterloo, Ontario to complete their graduate studies together.
